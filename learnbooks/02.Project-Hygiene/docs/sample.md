## Introduction

The 2019 season of the **Indian Premier League**, also known as IPL 12, was the twelfth season of the IPL, a professional Twenty20 cricket league established by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007.[1][2] At one point other countries were considered to host the tournament, due to the Indian general elections[3][4] but eventually the tournament was played entirely in India with the season commencing on 23 March.[5][6]

## Details 
-----------------
India's opening match at the 2019 Cricket World Cup was postponed from 2 to 5 June as the BCCI were directed to maintain a mandatory 15-day gap between the conclusion of IPL and India's subsequent international fixture as per Lodha Committee's recommendation.[7]

Delhi Daredevils were renamed as the Delhi Capitals, the franchise announced on 4 December 2018, and also released a new logo.[8] Chennai Super Kings were the defending champions.[9]
